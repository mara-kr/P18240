Changes from perl script:

-Note to user about forgetting to quit upon Ctrl+d removed.
-help => print_help, since help is reserved in python.
-Removed randomizing memory based on seed, used random.randint instead
-print_state removed, now get_state (returns string that would be printed), includes trailing newline
-fprint_regfile removed, now print_regfile (only prints to stdout)
-bs returns int, takes number as string
-mux only takes dictionary as input (no longer takes array)
-removed print_tran_lpr and "print" command (it wasn't in help text, likely
 never got used)

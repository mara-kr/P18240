AUTOLAB:

baseline:
-don't release scores until after due date (false release score)
-No scoreboard
-possibly create handout files for student to avoid autograding mishaps,
        (i.e. incorrectly named modules, etc)
-students submit .tar file (.tar of all .sv/.asm files for that homework)
        -handout .tar for student with make file?
        -teach students how to tar?
-Autograder runs at 5pm on submission day, no late homeworks. Last line
        of autograder gives scores for problems
        -autograder is script that runs each .sv/.list file with 
        testbench/simulator, parses output, and produces score for that
        problem (could stick with last line convention)
        -TA's add feedback on written portions and add score to autolab
        (group by section?) and bulk upload score grouped by problem
-students recieve scores on autolab the following friday
-exams, scores bulk graded, each team gets csv to enter into for problem,
        or just do as normal
-compute course average for student in gradebook, save students from 
        computing towards end of semester.

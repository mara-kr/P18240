User Guide for sim240:

Flags:
-r => run only; runs the program (same as r command in simulator), then exits
-n => no-randomize; doesn't randomize memory, just initializes to "0000"
-t => transcript; creates a transcript of simulator IO upon quitting
-q => quiet mode; simulator will not print state unless explicitly requested
-v => version; prints simulator version
-g [filename] => grade mode; Runs the program in quiet mode, then checks the
        state of the simulator against the given state file (filename), then
        exits.

Commands:
quit/q/exit => quits the simulator
help/h/? => prints help text
reset => resets the simulator (resets state to initial values)
run/run 5/run 5u/run 5q => runs the simulator. If no arguments are given, 
        the simulator runs until it reaches a STOP instruction or a breakpoint.
        If an argument is given (run [n]), run n instructions. If the argument
        is specified further (5q, 5u), the simulator prints state every
        instruction (i), micro-instruction (u), or never (q).
step => simulate a single instruction
ustep => simulate a single micro-instruction
break [addr/label] => sets a breakpoint at a given breakpoint or label
clear [addr/label] => clears a breakpoint at a given breakpoint or label
lsbrk => list all set breakpoints
save [filename] => saves the state of the simulator to a given filename
load [filename] => loads simulator state from a given filename
check [filename] => checks the current simulator state against the state in
        a given state file, and prints output.
reg_name = value => sets the value of a given register
reg_name? => prints the value of a given register. R*? prints the value of 
        R0-R7, *? prints the value of all registers.
m[addr]?/mem[addr]? => prints the value held in a given memory address
m[lo:hi]?/mem[lo:hi]? => prints the values held in memory locations between
        lo and hi, inclusive.

-PC option for run
-More intuitive user options
-Maybe explain breakpoints to students - in tutorial or otherwise
-Parsing list file more robust, labels can be longer than 6 characters
-multiple breakpoints per file
-breakpoints at .EQU points, does .EQU get replaced with const. at assemble-time
-Better documentation for test suite

Autograder - since SV is an HDL, the "easiest" way to manange problem
scores is to print lines to STDOUT and parse printed lines with python.

-Lines for the autograder must start with she-bang (#!).
Standard format - #![keyname, value]
Values are stored in a dictionary.
If value is a number, value for <keyname> is set to that value (created
if it doesn't exist).
If value is (+=/-= number or +=/-=number - maybe at ++/-- support), 
the value is incremented/decremented by that amount.
If value is rm, the value is removed.

-If lines for autograder starts with (#$), the autograder prints it,
with the (#$) removed from the start.

After python script recieved EOF, it outputs Autolab's JSON line of:
{ "scores": {"key0":value0, "key1":value1} }

tar -mxf autograde.tar
cp problem.sv handout
cd handout; make; ./simv -q | ./python-autograder
